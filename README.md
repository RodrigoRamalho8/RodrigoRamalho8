## Good to see you here...

At age of 24, I am an academic in technology area, studying Software Engineering at Sociedade de Ensino Superior Estácio de Sá and also Software Development, tech course, at Senac Hub Academy. Currently specializing and delving deeper into Angular, Java and .NET.
I'm in the 8th semester and currently working as a software developer.

I've already tried plenty of code languages and each of them had their own return for me.

Made part of various Code Marathons at my location, most of them in Python.

I dedicate my free time to studying languages, currently graduated in english with B2 grade, and monitoring new technologies, always keeping an eye on the market.
